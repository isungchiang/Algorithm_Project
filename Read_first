My project has two parts:
1.COMP4121_Project.pdf is the theory report of my project.
In order to save your time, if you dont want to read basic part that is in the textbook, please skip to Extend part at page12.
2. Project.ipynb is the implement part of my project.
It is written by python notebook. (very similar to Mathmatica)
If you want to run it yourself: 
	please install anaconda3 and open it. (see more http://jupyter.org/install.html)
else: 
	just read Project.html, it is the print version of python notebook.
